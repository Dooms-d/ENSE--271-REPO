General Thought Process:
In developing the Grocery Delivery App user story map, I focused on outlining the entire user journey from initial registration to delivery completion and feedback. My priority was a clear, logical flow of user activities that covers key interactions, while maintaining simplicity by targeting a functional subset of features. The story map organizes the experience into epics and steps that reflect both the customer and operational sides of the app.

Key Decisions :

1. Distinct Epics:
   I separated the backbone into epics such as "User Registration," "Search & Browse," "Order & Checkout," "Delivery," "Tracking," and "Feedback & Review" to clearly map major phases of user interaction and order management. This structure helps visualize progress in functional areas.

2. Dual Perspectives Included in Tracking and Delivery:
   Including both the "Driver Side" and "Customer Side" in the Tracking epic acknowledges the dual-user nature of delivery apps and ensures transparency for      both roles. This reflects practical needs in app workflows and improves real-world effectiveness.

3. Unscheduled Cards for Future Enhancements:
   To accommodate feature prioritization, I created a section for unscheduled tasks including wishlist, dietary preferences, live delivery map, and language selection. This supports a minimal viable product approach with room for iterative development.

Results in the Story Map:
- Epics visually grouped across the map's backbone represent major user goals and application stages.
- The use of separate cards for driver-related tasks (especially colored in orange) distinguishes operational components from customer-facing ones.
- Unscheduled tasks clearly set aside upcoming features without cluttering current releases, aiding planning and review.

Extra Feature Implemented:
I used color-coded cards as a visual aid to improve readability and task segmentation. Specifically, I assigned the orange color to all driver-related tasks and orders to immediately signal their role and priority. Along with color coding, I introduced personas implicitly by differentiating between customer and driver actions, enhancing the mapâ€™s clarity and user-role focus. This feature enhances team collaboration by providing quick visual cues, which is vital for larger projects involving multiple stakeholders.
